# Rossmann Sales Prediction

## Introduction

An end-to-end Data Science project with a regression adapted for time series as solution was created five machine learning models to forecast the sales. Predictions can be accessed by users through a bot from the smartphone app Telegram.

#### This project was made by Marx Cerqueira.
